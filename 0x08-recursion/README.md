# Recursion
This topic was necessary to understand recursion. It might seem like iteration but the concept of recursion is different from iteration. Iteration occurs when a loop repeatedly executes untill a certain condition is false, but recursion occurs when a function calls it self within. Below tasks helped me grasp more on recursion
## 0-puts_recursion.c
Function that prints a string
## 1-print_rev_recursion.c
Function that prints a string in reverse.
## 2-strlen_recursion.c
Function that returns the length of a string.
## 3-factorial.c
Function that returns the factorial of a given number.
## 4-pow_recursion.c
Function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
## 5-sqrt_recursion.c
Function that returns the natural square root of a number.
## 6-is_prime_number.c
Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
## 7-is_palindrome.c
Function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
## 100-wildcmp.c
Function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
## holberton.h
Contains all function prototypes and declarations for this project
