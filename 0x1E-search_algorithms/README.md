# Search Algorithms

This topic's aim was to understand:-

* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on needs

# FILES

Below task files are used to test understanding on various concepts

[0-linear.c](./0-linear.c)

Function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

* Prototype : `int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
* Returns `-1` if value is not present in array or if array is `NULL` else index where value is located

[1-binary.c](./1-binary.c)

Function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

* Prototype : `int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
* Returns `-1` if value is not present in array or if array is `NULL` else index where value is located
