# C - Functions, nested loops
This topic covers functions and nested loops as used in C. I understood that functions are procedures or methods that perform a particular task. Loops are used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Following task files were used to test topic understanding
## 0-holberton.c
program that prints Holberton
## 1-alphabet.c
print the alphabet, in lowercase
## 2-print_alphabet_x10.c
print 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
## 3-islower.c
check for lowercase characters
## 4-isalpha.c
check for alphabetic characters
## 5-sign.c
print the sign of a number
## 6-abs.c
computes the absolute value of an integer
## 7-print_last_digit.c
print the last digit of a number.
## 8-24_hours.c
print every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59
## 9-times_table.c
print the 9 times table, starting with 0
## 10-add.c
Adds two integers and returns the result
## 11-print_to_98.c
prints all natural numbers from n to 98
## holberton.h
contains functions prototypes
