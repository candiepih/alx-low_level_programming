# argc, argv
I found this topic interesting learning about passing arguments to the main. I grasped concepts on argc which i learnt can be referred to as argument count while argv is argument vector mainly a pointer to strings. So argc will be the number of strings pointed to by argv
## 0-whatsmyname.c
Program that prints its name, followed by a new line. On renaming the program, it prints the new name, without having to compile it again
## 1-args.c
Program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
## 2-args.c
Program that prints all arguments it receives.
## 3-mul.c
program that multiplies two numbers.
## 4-add.c
Program that adds positive numbers.
If no number is passed to the program, prints 0, followed by a new line
If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, prints Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
