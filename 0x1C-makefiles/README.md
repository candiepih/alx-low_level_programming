# C - Makefiles

Topics aim was to understand what makefiles are, how, why and when they should be used. Also topic helped in understanding:-
* What are rules and how to set and use them
* What are explicit and implicit rules
* What are the most common / useful rules
* What are variables and how to set and use them

Following task files helped in testing my understanding on the concept

[0-Makefile](./blob/main/0x1C-makefiles/0-Makefile)
