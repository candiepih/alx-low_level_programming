## 3-array_range.c
Function that creates an array of integers depending on range of numbers provided
## 100-realloc.c
Function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free. Works like library realloc function
## 101-mul.c
Program that multiplies two positive numbers.
## 101-mul_funcs.c
Contains some function definations used in 100-mul.c task file.
## holberton.h
